# Line-Follower-Bot
This is the basic bot that all students make when they begin their journey in the field of robotics
A line follower bot as the name suggests is a robot that follows a line. Generally the line that the bot would follow here would be made by the black insulation tape on any flat surface.

Principle: A line follower robot requires infrared sensors. Firstly, an infrared sensor is a sensor that detects infrared radiation in its surroundings. Before constructing the bot, let us first look at the main component that the bot uses to detect whether it is traversing a line or not. For all those who are not aware, an IR sensor has two LEDs namely IR Transmitter and IR Receiver. There is an LED in an IR transmitter that emits infrared light. The black part is either the photodiode or a phototransistor and is termed as the receiver. It is based on tansmission and reflection of infrared radiation. The IR transmitter emits infrared radiation, which reflects off a surface and reaches the receiver. As the light hits the receiver, it generates a potential difference across its ends. This potential difference is then interpreted by a microcontroller as either HIGH or LOW. A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit that executes specific tasks in electronic systems.



Contruction and Assembly: 

1. The motors were mounted on the chassis using hex nuts.
2. The wheels were attached to the motors using bolts.
3. The castor wheel was attached to the chassis at the front.
4. The motor driver, breadboard and the Arduino UNO was stuck at the top surface of the chassis using double-sided tape.
5. The IR sensors were fixed at the forward portion of the chassis with double sided tape.
